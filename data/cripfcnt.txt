CRIPFCnt (by Donald Mataranyika)

CRIPFCnt is a framework merging unconventional science, psychology, curiosity, placement, and society.
It’s not a brand, but a becoming—a recalibration of intelligence and systems.

SCOI (Systemic Contribution Over Income) = Voluntary Impact − Negative Externalities

The purpose of CRIPFCnt is to measure institutional or systemic value by quantifying true contribution, not wealth.

Applications include:
- Evaluating education systems
- Redefining football strategy
- Measuring institutional impact

Philosophy:
Value = What contributes positively to the system without creating new harm.
