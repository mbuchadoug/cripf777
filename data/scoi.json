    "explanation": "Delta demonstrates a high level of voluntary impact (85) through its aggressive targets for carbon neutrality and substantial community engagement initiatives. The investment in sustainable aviation fuel and fuel efficiency reflects significant efforts towards environmental responsibility. Negative externalities (60) are present due to the nature of the airline industry, which inherently contributes to greenhouse gas emissions. However, Delta's initiatives mitigate some of these negative effects. Income dependence (40) is moderate as the company is reliant on consumer demand for air travel, which can be influenced by economic fluctuations. Overall, Delta's integrated sustainability strategies are commendable but still face challenges typical of the airline sector.",
